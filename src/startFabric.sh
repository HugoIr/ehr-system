JavaScript:

  Start by changing into the "javascript" directory:
    cd javascript

  Next, install all required packages:
    npm install

  Then run the following applications to enroll the admin user, and register a new user
  called appUser which will be used by the other applications to interact with the deployed
  EHR contract:
    node enrollAdmin
    node registerUser

  You can run the invoke application as follows. By default, the invoke application will
  create a new ehr, but you can update the application to submit other transactions:
    node invoke

  You can run the query application as follows. By default, the query application will
  return all ehrs, but you can update the application to evaluate other transactions:
    node query
